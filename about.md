Hi, I am Laura Cabello. I recently completed a Masters degree in Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Zaragoza.
Currently I am working as a researcher within the audio group at my hometown university. My principal research interests are signal processing, audio technologies and natural language processing (NLP). And I love when they help to solve real, human problems.

I am a curious person and I do enjoy traveling the world. All these experiences shape who I am today and help me to gain a richer understanding of life.

*"I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it’s hard to stay mad when there’s so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I’m seeing it all at once, and it’s too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that’s about to burst. And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain, and I can’t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life."*
