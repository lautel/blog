    <p>
      Hi, I am Laura Cabello. I recently completed a Masters degree in Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Zaragoza.
      Currently I am working as a researcher within the audio group at my hometown university. 
      My principal research interests are signal processing and Natural Language Processing. And I love when they solve real, human problems.
              
    
      <em>"I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it’s hard to stay mad when there’s so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I’m seeing it all at once, and it’s too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that’s about to burst. And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain, and I can’t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life."</em>
